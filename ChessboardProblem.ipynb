    "There's an old story about an inventor who did a great service for a king. (In some versions of the story, he has invented the game of chess!) When the king asks what he would like for a reward, the inventor grabs a chessboard and places a single grain of rice on a corner square. He explains that he wants to be paid in rice over the next couple of months. On the first day, the king will pay a single grain of rice. He adds two grains to the next square and explains: on the second day, the king will pay two grains of rice. On the third, four grains. The amount to be paid will double every day. In almost all versions of the story, the king takes him up on this offer. But how long until the king realizes he's made a big mistake? \n",

    "The calculations involved are simple in a brute-force kind of way, so I thought this story would be a good inspiration for my first Python project. This function calculates how much rice gets added on each day and keeps a running total of the number of grains and the weight of the rice. \n",

It cuts it off at two decimal places for the smallest units and at the integer for the larger units. This truncation only happens in the printing though -- all of the calculations are done on the full numeric value.

Although estimates seem to vary widely, the mass of the Titanic is about [46,000 tons](http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_statistics.shtml), so by day 64 our inventor would have an amount of rice weighing as much as almost 7 million Titanics.
